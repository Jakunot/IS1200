  <p style ="text-align:center"><samp>The course gives basic knowledge of how a computer functions and is built-up both from a hardware and from a software perspective 
  The course is divided into six different modules, which for example include the following basic concepts:</samp></p>
  
  --- 
  
  <ul>
    <li><samp>C-programming and assembler language: pointers, functions, stack, assembly language, machine language, instruction encoding and processor registers.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>I/O system: timers, interrupts and memory mapped I/O.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Digital design: truth tables, gates, boolean algebra, multiplexers, decoders, adders, combinatorial nets, sequential networks and registers.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Processor construction: arithmetic-logic unit, data path, control unit and pipeline.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Memory architectures: instruction cache, data cache and virtual memory.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Parallel processors and programs: Amdahl's law, different variants of parallelism as well as multicore.</samp></li>
   </ul>
