  <p style ="text-align:center"><samp>The purpose of the laboratory exercises is to get "hands-on" experience with programming and design</samp></p>
  
  
  <h2 style ="text-align:center"><samp>Lab 1</samp></h2>

  <p style ="text-align:center"><samp> After finishing this lab, you should be able to :</samp></p>
    <ul>
    <li><samp>Canalyze MIPS assembly code by using a simulator.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>write short assembly code functions in MIPS assembler.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>execute and test a compiled program on a PIC32 microcontroller.</samp></li>
   </ul>

   <h2 style ="text-align:center"><samp>Lab 2</samp></h2>
   <p style ="text-align:center"><samp>  In this lab, you will learn the basics of the C programming language. More specifically, after finishing this lab, you will be able to :</samp></p>
    <ul>
    <li><samp>construct shorter C programs that includes for-loops, if-statements, arrays, and pointers.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>analyze C programs and understand how a compiled program is laid out in memory.</samp></li>
   </ul>

   <h2 style ="text-align:center"><samp>Lab 3</samp></h2>
   <p style ="text-align:center"><samp>In this laboratory exercise you will learn the fundamentals of input/output, timers, and interrupt programming. After finishing this lab, you should be able to :</samp></p>
   <ul>

    <li><samp>Write code to initialize and use simple input/output devices, such as buttons and LEDs.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Write code to initialize and use devices with handshaking, such as a programmable timer.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Write code to initialize and handle interrupts.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Have a general understand for how to read non-trivial technical manuals, data sheets, and header files.</samp></li>
   </ul>

   <h2 style ="text-align:center"><samp>Lab 4</samp></h2>
   <p style ="text-align:center"><samp>In this laboratory exercise, you will learn the fundamentals of processor design. After finishing this lab, you should be able to :</samp></p>
   <ul>
    <li><samp>Construct a simple single-cycle processor that executes a real assembly program.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Explain how bit selection and instruction decoding works.</samp></li>
    <li><samp>Explain the basic principles of the data path and the control unit.</samp></li>
   </ul>
